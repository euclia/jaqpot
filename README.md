# Jaqpot

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Releasing

For releasing new versions of the Angular app, use manual tagging following semantic versioning (e.g., 1.1.0, 1.2.0). Upon tagging, the image is automatically published to Docker Hub at [upcintua/jaqpot-frontend](https://hub.docker.com/r/upcintua/jaqpot-frontend). Ensure tags align with project milestones and feature additions for consistency and clarity in version management.
